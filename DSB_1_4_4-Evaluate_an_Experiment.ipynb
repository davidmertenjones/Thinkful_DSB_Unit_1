    "## The Sith Lords are concerned that their recruiting slogan, \"Give In to Your Anger,\" isn't very effective. Darth Vader develops an alternative slogan, \"Together We Can Rule the Galaxy.\" They compare the slogans on two groups of 50 captured droids each. In one group, Emperor Palpatine delivers the \"Anger\" slogan. In the other, Darth Vader presents the \"Together\" slogan. 20 droids convert to the Dark Side after hearing Palpatine's slogan, while only 5 droids convert after hearing Vader's. The Sith's data scientist concludes that \"Anger\" is a more effective slogan and should continue to be used."

    "This study makes no mention of how the 100 droids were selected to be in two groups, other than there are two groups of 50 captured droids each. If the group assigned to Darth Vader is composed primarily of Rebel astromech droids and the group assigned to Emperor Palpatine is composed of assassin droids who are not aligned to the Alliance or the Empire, the droids' programming might affect their willingness to accept the slogans. Randomization may help reduce bias from improper conditional assignment.\n",

    "Furthermore, this comparison is probably subject to a fair amount of contextual bias. Darth Vader may not be as charismatic a speaker as Emperor Palpatine, so regardless of the potency of the slogan itself, its delivery may also be a factor. This bias may be reduced by splitting the droids into four groups rather than two, and having each Sith Lord deliver both slogans."

    "## In the past, the Jedi have had difficulty with public relations. They send two envoys, Jar Jar Binks and Mace Windu, to four friendly and four unfriendly planets respectively, with the goal of promoting favorable feelings toward the Jedi. Upon their return, the envoys learn that Jar Jar was much more effective than Windu: Over 75% of the people surveyed said their attitudes had become more favorable after speaking with Jar Jar, while only 65% said their attitudes had become more favorable after speaking with Windu. This makes Windu angry, because he is sure that he had a better success rate than Jar Jar on every planet. The Jedi choose Jar Jar to be their representative in the future."
