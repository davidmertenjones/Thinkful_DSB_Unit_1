    "Rentals are slow at Polly's Pets. Polly's website was built in the early 2000s, and doesn't have the sleek appearance or easy user experience modern retail websites offer. Competitor Craig's Critters has a modern web page, and has recently expanded to four locations in the tri-city area. Polly's daughter Penny has been taking a web design course at the local community college, and offers to spruce up the old website.

    "\n",
    "* Create a second version of the website, with updated graphics and a less convoluted \"store\" subpage.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For one month, when visitors goes to pollyspets.com, half the time, they will be redirected at random to pollys.pets, the updated page. User IP addresses will be recorded, so future visits from the same IP address will be redirected to the same page to which they were assigned on their first visit during the test period.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Record session ID information for each of the two sites, including time spent on the website, number of animals rented, and whether the user is a repeat customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "* After a month has gone by, conduct a t-test using the rental data gathered during the test period. If rentals during the test period are higher for the new page by at least 10%, shift to using the new page exclusively. If rentals are higher on the new page but the statistical tests do not show significant difference, continue observations for another month. If sales on the new page are not higher, go back to using the old page."
